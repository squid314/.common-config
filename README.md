# Scripty Stuff
Just a collection of scripts and script-like things (configs, etc.) of which I want to keep track.

Default config files exist here (.vimrc, .tmux.conf, etc.) which source in file(s) from this repository to extend functionality. This provides a nice, simple quick start platform to get your environment configured.

## TODOs

* add script to copy everything from this repo to the user's home directory and replace any mandatory absolute paths with correct ones
